<strong><em>When you are old </em></strong>
<br>
--- William Butler Yeats 
<br>
<br>
When you are old and grey and full of sleep, <br>
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, <br>
And slowly read,and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; <br>
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, <br>
But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; <br>
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly,how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead <br>
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
