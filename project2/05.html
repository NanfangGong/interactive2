When &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



you &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




are &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




old &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




and &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




grey &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




and &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
 




full &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
 



of &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




sleep, <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


And &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




nodding &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




by &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




the &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 





fire, &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp





take &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 





down &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp





this &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



book, <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



And &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




slowly &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



read, &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



and &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



dream &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
 



of &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




the &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




soft &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



look &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 



Your &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



eyes &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
 


had &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



once, &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



and &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
 

of &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




their &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




shadows &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


deep; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



How &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



many &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



loved &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



your &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



moments &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
 


of &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



glad &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



grace, &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

And &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp
 


loved &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




your &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




beauty &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



with &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




love &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




false &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




or &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




true, <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


But &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




one &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



man &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




loved &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



the &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp




pilgrim &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



Soul &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




in &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



you &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



And &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 





loved &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



the &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



sorrows &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp





of &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp





your &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



changing &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



face; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



And &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 





bending &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




down &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


beside &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



the &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



glowing &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp



bars, &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp


Murmur, &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 




a &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


little &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


sadly, &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

how &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


Love &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


fled &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

And &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


paced &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


upon &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



the &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


mountains &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 

overhead <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

And &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 



hid &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


his &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


face &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


amid &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


a &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


crowd &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


of &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 


stars.
