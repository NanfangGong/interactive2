When you are old 
<br>
--- William Butler Yeats 
<br>
<br>
<p>
When &nbsp&nbsp you &nbsp&nbsp are &nbsp&nbsp old &nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp grey &nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp full &nbsp&nbsp of &nbsp&nbsp sleep, <br>


And &nbsp&nbsp nodding &nbsp&nbsp by &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp fire, &nbsp&nbsp take &nbsp&nbsp down &nbsp&nbsp this &nbsp&nbsp book, <br>

And &nbsp&nbsp slowly &nbsp&nbsp read, &nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp dream &nbsp&nbsp of &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp soft &nbsp&nbsp look <br>

Your &nbsp&nbsp eyes &nbsp&nbsp had &nbsp&nbsp once, &nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp of &nbsp&nbsp their &nbsp&nbsp shadows &nbsp&nbsp deep; <br>


How &nbsp&nbsp many &nbsp&nbsp loved &nbsp&nbsp your &nbsp&nbsp moments &nbsp&nbsp of &nbsp&nbsp glad &nbsp&nbsp grace, 
<br>

And &nbsp&nbsp loved &nbsp&nbsp your &nbsp&nbsp beauty &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp with &nbsp&nbsp love &nbsp&nbsp false &nbsp&nbsp or &nbsp&nbsp true, <br>


But &nbsp&nbsp one &nbsp&nbsp man &nbsp&nbsp loved &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp pilgrim &nbsp&nbsp Soul &nbsp&nbsp in &nbsp&nbsp you 

<br>

And &nbsp&nbsp loved &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp sorrows &nbsp&nbsp of &nbsp&nbsp your &nbsp&nbsp changing &nbsp&nbsp face; 

<br>

And &nbsp&nbsp bending &nbsp&nbsp down &nbsp&nbsp beside &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp glowing &nbsp&nbsp bars, 


&nbsp&nbsp Murmur, &nbsp&nbsp a &nbsp&nbsp little &nbsp&nbsp sadly, &nbsp&nbsp how &nbsp&nbsp Love &nbsp&nbsp fled 
<br>

And &nbsp&nbsp paced &nbsp&nbsp upon &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp mountains &nbsp&nbsp overhead <br>


And &nbsp&nbsp hid &nbsp&nbsp his &nbsp&nbsp face &nbsp&nbsp amid &nbsp&nbsp a &nbsp&nbsp crowd &nbsp&nbsp of &nbsp&nbsp stars.
