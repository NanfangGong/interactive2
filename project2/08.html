When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
</span>


<h1>And slowly read,and dream of the soft look </h1>


<span>Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; </span>

<span>How many loved your moments of glad grace, </span>

<h2>And loved your beauty with love false or true, </h2>

<span>But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you </span>

<h3>And loved the sorrows of your changing face; </h3>

<h3>And bending down beside the glowing bars, </h3>

<span>Murmur, a little sadly,how Love fled </span>

<h4>And paced upon the mountains overhead </h4>
<h4>And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</h4>
