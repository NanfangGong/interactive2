<ol style="color:blue;">
<li><span>When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
</span></li>






<li><h1>And slowly read,and dream of the soft look </h1></li>








<li><span>Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; </span></li>
<li><span>How many loved your moments of glad grace, </span></li>




<li><h2>And loved your beauty with love false or true, </h2><li>



<li><span>But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you </span></li>


<li><h3>And loved the sorrows of your changing face; </h3></li>

<li><h3>And bending down beside the glowing bars, </h3></li>

<li><span>Murmur, a little sadly,how Love fled </span></li>


<li><h4>And paced upon the mountains overhead </h4></li>

 

<li><h4>And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</h4> </li>
