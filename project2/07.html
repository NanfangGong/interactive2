When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 

<h1>And slowly read,and dream of the soft look </h1>

Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
<h1>And loved your beauty with love false or true, </h1>
But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you 
<h1>And loved the sorrows of your changing face; </h1>
<h1>And bending down beside the glowing bars, </h1>
Murmur, a little sadly,how Love fled 
<h1>And paced upon the mountains overhead </h1>
<h1>And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</h1>
