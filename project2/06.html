<strong><em>When you are old <em></strong>


--- William Butler Yeats

<span>When you are old and grey and full of sleep,</span> 

<span>And nodding by the fire, take down this book, </span>
<span>And slowly read,and dream of the soft look </span>
<span>Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; </span>
<span>How many loved your moments of glad grace, </span>
<span>And loved your beauty with love false or true, </span>
<span>But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you </span>
<span>And loved the sorrows of your changing face; </span>
<span>And bending down beside the glowing bars, </span>
Murmur, a little sadly,how Love fled 
<span>And paced upon the mountains overhead </span>
<span>And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
