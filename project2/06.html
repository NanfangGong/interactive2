<span>When you are old and grey and full of sleep,</span>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>And nodding by the fire, take down this book, </span>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>And slowly read,and dream of the soft look </span>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; </span>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>How many loved your moments of glad grace, </span>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>And loved your beauty with love false or true, </span>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp

 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you </span>

 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>And loved the sorrows of your changing face; </span>

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>And bending down beside the glowing bars, </span>
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
Murmur, a little sadly,how Love fled 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>And paced upon the mountains overhead </span>
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
 &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp 
<span>And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
