<h1>When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
</h1>






<h1>And slowly read,and dream of the soft look </h1>








<h1>Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; </h1>
<h1>How many loved your moments of glad grace, </h1>




<h2>And loved your beauty with love false or true, </h2>



<h2>But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you </h2>


<h3>And loved the sorrows of your changing face; </h3>

<h3>And bending down beside the glowing bars, </h3>

<h3>Murmur, a little sadly,how Love fled </h3>

<h4>And paced upon the mountains overhead </h4>

 
<h4>And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</h4>
